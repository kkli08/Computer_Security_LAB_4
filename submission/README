Part1:
    1. In order to find the IPv4 address for utoronto,ca, I use: dig utoronto.ca
    2. In order to find the name of the name server with their IP address, I use: dig utoronto.ca NS
    3. In order to find the names of the mail server with their IP address, 
        I use:
        dig utoronto.ca MX
        and then:
        dig utoronto-ca.mail.protection.outlook.com
    4. the output matches the the result.
        I use: 
        dig @127.0.0.1 -p <NAMED port number> <args>
        
Part2:
    socket programming in python, establish the connection and when user try to use
    dig to execute a dns query at localhost, it send to my dns proxy port, after the 
    proxy receive the data, forward it to the real local dns server, and get response
    from the dns server. Finally, send back what dns server send back to the proxy to 
    the user.

Part3:
    when the proxy comes to spoof attck mode, I use scapy to modified the packet send back
    from the dns server. when the qname == 'example.com.', modified the packet information
    by reconstructing with rdata='1.2.3.4', change its name servers rdata='ns.dnslabattacker.net.'
